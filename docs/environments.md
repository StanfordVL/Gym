# Environments

This is a list of Gym environments, including those packaged with Gym, official OpenAI environments, and third party environment.

For information on creating your own environment, see [Creating your own Environment](creating-environments.md).

## Included Environments

The code for each environment group is housed in its own subdirectory
[gym/envs](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs). The
specification of each task is in
[gym/envs/\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/__init__.py).
It's worth browsing through both.

### Algorithmic

These are a variety of algorithmic tasks, such as learning to copy a
sequence.

``` python
import gym
env = gym.make('Copy-v0')
env.reset()
env.render()
```

### Atari

The Atari environments are a variety of Atari video games. If you didn't
do the full install, you can install dependencies via `pip install -e
'.[atari]'` (you'll need `cmake` installed) and then get started as
follows:

``` python
import gym
env = gym.make('SpaceInvaders-v0')
env.reset()
env.render()
```

This will install `atari-py`, which automatically compiles the [Arcade
Learning Environment](http://www.arcadelearningenvironment.org/). This
can take quite a while (a few minutes on a decent laptop), so just be
prepared.

### Box2d

Box2d is a 2D physics engine. You can install it via `pip install -e
'.[box2d]'` and then get started as follows:

``` python
import gym
env = gym.make('LunarLander-v2')
env.reset()
env.render()
```

### Classic control

These are a variety of classic control tasks, which would appear in a
typical reinforcement learning textbook. If you didn't do the full
install, you will need to run `pip install -e '.[classic_control]'` to
enable rendering. You can get started with them via:

``` python
import gym
env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')
env.reset()
env.render()
```

### MuJoCo

[MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org/) is a physics engine which can do very
detailed efficient simulations with contacts. It's not open-source, so
you'll have to follow the instructions in
[mujoco-py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#obtaining-the-binaries-and-license-key)
to set it up. You'll have to also run `pip install -e '.[mujoco]'` if
you didn't do the full install.

``` python
import gym
env = gym.make('Humanoid-v2')
env.reset()
env.render()
```

### Robotics

These environments also use [MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org/). You'll have to also run `pip install -e '.[robotics]'` if
you didn't do the full install.

``` python
import gym
env = gym.make('HandManipulateBlock-v0')
env.reset()
env.render()
```

You can also find additional details in the accompanying [technical
report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09464) and [blog
post](https://blog.openai.com/ingredients-for-robotics-research/). If
you use these environments, you can cite them as follows:

    @misc{1802.09464,
      Author = {Matthias Plappert and Marcin Andrychowicz and Alex Ray and Bob McGrew and Bowen Baker and Glenn Powell and Jonas Schneider and Josh Tobin and Maciek Chociej and Peter Welinder and Vikash Kumar and Wojciech Zaremba},
      Title = {Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning: Challenging Robotics Environments and Request for Research},
      Year = {2018},
      Eprint = {arXiv:1802.09464},
    }

### Toy text

Toy environments which are text-based. There's no extra dependency to
install, so to get started, you can just do:

``` python
import gym
env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v0')
env.reset()
env.render()
```

## OpenAI Environments

### Procgen

16 simple-to-use procedurally-generated gym environments which provide a direct measure of how quickly a reinforcement learning agent learns generalizable skills. The environments run at high speed (thousands of steps per second) on a single core.

Learn more here: https://github.com/openai/procgen

### Gym-Retro

Gym Retro lets you turn classic video games into Gym environments for reinforcement learning and comes with integrations for ~1000 games. It uses various emulators that support the Libretro API, making it fairly easy to add new emulators.

### Roboschool (DEPRECATED)

**We recommend using the [PyBullet Robotics Environments](#pybullet-robotics-environments) instead**

3D physics environments like Mujoco environments but uses the Bullet physics engine and does not require a commercial license.

Learn more here: https://github.com/openai/roboschool

## Third Party Environments

The gym comes prepackaged with many many environments. It's this common API around many environments that makes Gym so great. Here we will list additional environments that do not come prepacked with the gym. Submit another to this list via a pull-request.

### PyBullet Robotics Environments

3D physics environments like the Mujoco environments but uses the Bullet physics engine and does not require a commercial license.  Works on Mac/Linux/Windows.

### NASGym: gym environment for Neural Architecture Search (NAS)

The environment is fully-compatible with the OpenAI baselines and exposes a NAS environment following the Neural Structure Code of [BlockQNN: Efficient Block-wise Neural Network Architecture Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05584). Under this setting, a Neural Network (i.e. the state for the reinforcement learning agent) is modeled as a list of NSCs, an action is the addition of a layer to the network, and the reward is the accuracy after the early-stop training. The datasets considered so far are the CIFAR-10 dataset (available by default) and the meta-dataset (has to be manually downloaded as specified in [this repository](https://github.com/gomerudo/meta-dataset)).

Learn more here: https://github.com/gomerudo/nas-env

### gym-jiminy: training Robots in Jiminy

gym-jiminy presents an extension of the initial OpenAI gym for robotics using Jiminy, an extremely fast and light weight simulator for poly-articulated systems using Pinocchio for physics evaluation and Meshcat for web-based 3D rendering.

### highway-env: Tactical Decision-Making for Autonomous Driving

An environment for behavioural planning in autonomous driving, with an emphasis on high-level perception and decision rather than low-level sensing and control. The difficulty of the task lies in understanding the social interactions with other drivers, whose behaviours are uncertain. Several scenes are proposed, such as highway, merge, intersection and roundabout.
